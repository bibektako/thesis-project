# Project Summary (Non-Technical)

This project is a mobile app that helps people take part in trekking challenges in a fair, fun, and trackable way.

## What the app lets users do

- **Create an account and sign in**: Users can register and log in to keep their progress and points.
- **Browse challenges**: Users can view available trekking challenges and see what each one requires.
- **Complete checkpoints**: Each challenge is made of checkpoints that users complete one-by-one in the real world.
- **Submit proof at each checkpoint**: When a user reaches a checkpoint, the app asks them to:
  - take a photo of the checkpoint sign, and
  - take a selfie when required, and
  - record their current location at the time of submission.
- **Get a clear outcome**: Each submission receives a result such as approved, rejected, or needing a quick admin review if something is unclear.
- **Track progress**: Users can view their submissions, see which checkpoints are completed, and monitor overall progress.
- **Earn points and view rankings**: Verified checkpoints award points, and a ranking screen shows top performers to encourage friendly competition.

## Admin features

- **Create and manage challenges**: Admins can add, edit, activate/deactivate, or remove challenges and checkpoints.
- **Review unclear submissions**: Admins can approve or reject submissions that require manual review, with an optional reason.
- **View basic statistics**: Admins can see totals (users, challenges, submissions) and how many submissions need review.

## Privacy and consent (plain language)

- **Camera and location access**: The app asks the user for permission before using the camera or recording location.
- **Optional face-based checks**: The app includes an optional face-based feature for stronger verification. This is **off by default** and only used if the user chooses to enable it.
- **What is recorded**: Account details (like username and email), challenge progress, submission results, and the photos/selfies and location used for each checkpoint submission.
